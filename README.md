# Term-Project-Bayesian-Regression-Analysis
A bayesian regression analysis with R and Stan.
Conduct a series of Bayesian regression analyses to test whether an association between 2 variables is genuine, with rethinking package.
 Specifically, fit the following models:
• a simple linear regression with log(population size) as independent variable and log(sound inventory size) as dependent variable
• a hierarchical model with language families as random effect,
• a hierarchical model with language families as random effect,
• a hierarchical model with both language families and continents as random effect.

Use Stan to estimate the posterior distributions.
Repeat theses analysis with a Poisson regression instead of a linear regression, with untrans- formed number of phonemes as dependent variable.

Using prior predictive checks to determine a wisely-chosen prior.
Model comparison via WAIC.

A discussion about findings is included.
